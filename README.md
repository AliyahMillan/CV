# Introduction

Hullo, my name is Aliyah Millán and this is my website.
I am a student at California State University Fullerton (CSUF)
and I'm using this website as a way to add to my resumé.

## My Project

I used HTML/CSS to create my website, and I'm pretty proud of it.
I know it might look rough, but I pretty much learnt everything
about HTML/CSS online, and I thouroughly enjoyed making this.
